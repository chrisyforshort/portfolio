Welcome to the wonderful (and still under construction) portfolio website for Christina Sarah Wu! 

This website was created with HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and my first time using the Materialize CDN EVER. I drew inspiration from other developers websites and the Materialize documentation for the style of my portfolio. I went with a comic book like feel because I love pretty much all things Geeky. I'm still waiting to play my first Dungeons and Dragons game though, so let me know if you're looking to add someone to your game. 

I have named this portfolio interative because I aspire to make everything click-able and the scrollspy function from Materialize is awesome. I love how it just gives the website life as you're able to watch it scroll through. 

Please enjoy my portfolio and please message me for critques, concerns, and questions. Cheers!

-Christina Wu
