# The Portfolio of Christina Sarah Wu

Welcome to the wonderful (and still under construction) portfolio website for Christina Sarah Wu!

## Summary
This website was created from scratch with HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and the Materialize CDN (first time using Materialize). I drew inspiration from other developers websites and the Materialize documentation for the style of my portfolio. I went with a comic book like feel because I love all things geeky. I'm still waiting to play my first Dungeons and Dragons game though, so let me know if you're looking to add someone to your game. 

I have named this portfolio interative because I aspire to make everything click-able and the scrollspy function from Materialize is awesome. I love how it just gives the website life as you're able to watch it scroll through. 

Please enjoy my portfolio and please message me for critques, concerns, and questions. Cheers!

-Christina Wu

## Pending Upgrades/Features to be Developed

Most of the main features are functioning on the site. I'm currently in the process of working out the media quaries to have the site more responsive. I still need to add more links to the experience section. I wish to bring in the Google Maps API so when you hover over the locations in the Experiences sections, you can see where each is.
